# If user has chosen auto configuration, this script does the following:
# - Create a Procfile.
# - Add gunicorn to requirements.txt.
# - Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS setting to allow serving from Heroku.
# - Configure database so the Heroku postgres instance works.
# - Configure staticfiles.
# - Other?

# This script could be organized quite differently. ie first step could focus
#   on modifying dependencies, then settings, etc. But I think it's much easier
#   to reason about by focusing on each step of the configuration process.
# For example it's better to make all changes necessary for configuring db,
#   then static files, even if that means modifying settings file more than once.
